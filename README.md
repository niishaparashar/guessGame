Number Guessing Game
A simple number guessing game built with Python and Tkinter. The player sets a range by specifying lower and upper bounds, and the game generates a random number within that range. The player has 7 chances to guess the correct number, receiving feedback such as "Too high!" or "Too low!" after each guess.
Features

Graphical User Interface: Built with Tkinter for an interactive experience.
Input Validation: Ensures valid numbers for bounds and guesses with error pop-ups.
Feedback System: Provides clear feedback on each guess and tracks remaining chances.
Simple Design: Easy-to-use interface suitable for beginners.

Requirements:

Python 3.6 or higher
Tkinter (included with standard Python installations)

Installation

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/number-guessing-game.git
cd number-guessing-game


Verify Tkinter is installed:python -m tkinter

A test window should appear. If not, install Tkinter:
Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install python3-tk
Fedora: sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
Windows/Mac: Tkinter is typically included with Python. Reinstall Python if missing.



Usage

Run the game:python number_guessing_game.py


In the game window:
Enter the lower and upper bounds for the number range.
Click "Set Range" to start the game.
Enter a guess and click "Guess" to receive feedback.
You have 7 chances to guess the correct number.
Feedback will indicate if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.



Troubleshooting

UI Not Showing Up:
Ensure you're running the script in a graphical environment (not a headless server).
Check the terminal for error messages after running the script.
Test Tkinter with:import tkinter
tkinter.Tk().mainloop()


If no window appears, verify Tkinter installation or try a different Python version (e.g., 3.8+).
Linux: Ensure a display server (X11/Wayland) is running. For headless servers, use xvfb-run python number_guessing_game.py.
Mac: Tkinter may have issues on some macOS versions. Try installing Python via Homebrew (brew install python-tk).


Invalid Input Errors: Ensure you enter valid integers for bounds and guesses.
